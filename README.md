# MPM-Julia
Julia implementation of the material point method (MPM), see the following paper for detail

S. Sinai, V.P. Nguyen, C.T. Nguyen and S. Bordas. [Programming the Material Point Method in Julia.][mpm-in-julia]
Advances in Engineering Software,105: 17--29, 2017.

> The code was written 2 years ago and thus not compatible to the current Julia version.

[This branch `julia-LTS`][julia-LTS] contain codes works well on Julia 1.0+ (test on julia 1.3.1).
